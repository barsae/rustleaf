# Commit Work in Progress

## Context
- Current git status: !git status
- Current git diff: !git diff
- Recent commit history: !git log --oneline -5

## Your task

**Commit all changes systematically**:
   - Review all staged and unstaged changes
   - Add untracked files that should be committed
   - Create logical, well-described commits using multiple commits if needed
   - Follow the repository's existing commit message style
   - Stage and commit all changes systematically

Create meaningful commit messages that describe what was changed and why. If there are many different types of changes, split them into separate logical commits.
