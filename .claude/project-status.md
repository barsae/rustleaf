# Project Status Analysis

Analyze the RustLeaf language implementation and regenerate the STATUS.md file with current implementation status.

## Instructions

You are tasked with analyzing the RustLeaf programming language implementation and creating a comprehensive status matrix. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the language specifications** from `./specs/*.md` to understand what features should be implemented
2. **Analyze the current Rust implementation** by examining:
   - `src/lexer/*` - lexical analysis implementation
   - `src/parser/*` - parsing and AST implementation  
   - `src/eval/*` - evaluation and runtime implementation
   - `tests/*` - test coverage and working features
3. **Determine implementation status** for each specification chapter across these components:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Complete**: Feature fully implemented and tested
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Partial**: Feature partially implemented, core functionality works
   - ðŸŸ  **Minimal**: Feature has basic structure but not functional
   - ðŸ”´ **Missing**: Feature not implemented at all
4. **Generate STATUS.md** with:
   - Implementation status matrix table with links to gap analysis
   - Gap analysis with separate sections for Parser/Evaluator/Testing gaps
   - Overall progress summary with Complete/Incomplete sections (no quality assessments)
   - Current capabilities and limitations

## Key Requirements

- Link all non-green status emojis to relevant gap analysis sections
- Include current git commit hash in the "Last updated" line
- Use centered emoji columns in the status table
- Be specific about what's implemented vs. placeholder code
- Focus on actual working functionality, not just structural code
- In gap analysis, separate Parser/Evaluator/Testing gaps for clarity
- In progress summary, use factual statements without quality assessments

## Output Format

Write the complete STATUS.md file that can be used to track implementation progress against the language specification.
